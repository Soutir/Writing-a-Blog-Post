## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Python 3 is required for this Project.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Data Science Nanodegree project. I chose FIFA 19 dataset to answer the following questions:

1. Which Countries are having the most number of Players?
2. Who are the most Valuable and Highly Paid Players?
3. Which are Clubs having more Valuable and Highly Paid Players?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

fifa19.csv contains lastest edition FIFA 2019 players attributes including age, potential, wage, etc. 

There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to my three questions.
